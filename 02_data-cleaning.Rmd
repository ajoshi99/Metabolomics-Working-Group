The extracted data set has 500 observations of 1314 variables

```{r include=FALSE}
df <- read_csv(here("data", "1_metabolite.csv")) 
```

1.  **Remove faulty sample points**

    -   Removed 30 individuals who had their blood drawn incorrectly or have withdrawn/been removed from the study

    -   470 observations of 1314 variables

```{r errors}
# step 1: load file of individuals that have been marked for second review
remove = read_csv(here("data", "raw", "outliers.csv"))

# step 2: select individuals that have been removed from the main data
remove0 = subset(remove, remove$Exclude == 1) %>% select(Assay)

# step 3: remove the erroneous Assay ID
df_clean = df[!df$Assay %in% remove0$Assay, ]

# step 4: remove unnecessary files
rm(remove, remove0)
```

2.  **Add household ID and individual ID information for easy identification**

    -   Removed 11 individuals with duplicate ID

    -   459 observations of 1312 variables

```{r studyID}
# step 1:  extract necessary variables from the ID file
id <-
    read_csv(here("data", "raw", "PRISM linking IDs_clean.csv")) %>% 
    select("Assay", "type", "HID", "IID_2", "Cohort")

# step 2: change the nomenclature to reflect the file to match
id <- 
    id %>% 
    mutate(Assay =  
               if_else(id$type == "original", 
                       paste0(id$Assay, " M"), 
                       paste0(id$Assay, " A2")))

# step 3: merge the ID file with the full data file, keep all the metabolite data
# 470 observations of 1313 variables
df_clean_id = merge(id, df_clean, by = "Assay", all.y = TRUE)

# step 4: remove duplicate ID
# 459 observations of 1312 variables
# Removed 11 duplicated IDs
df_clean_id0 = subset(df_clean_id, df_clean_id$type == "original") %>%
    select(-type)

# step 4: remove unnecessary files
rm(id, df_clean_id)
```

3.  **Create a new `studyID` variable**

    \
    There are a few households (HID) that have more than one child in the study, so HID cannot be used as an unique identifier. Concatenate HID-IID to create a new variable: `studyID_2`

    -   459 observations of 1313 variables

```{r create-new-var}
# create a duplicate file 
clean <- df_clean_id0

# add a new variable, studyID_2
clean0 = clean %>%
    mutate(studyID_2 = paste0(clean$HID, "-", clean$IID_2)) %>%
    select(Assay, studyID_2, everything())
```

4.  **Add serum information**

    -   459 observations of 1314 variables

```{r serum}
# step 1: load serum data
serum = read_csv(here("data", "raw", "serum_wk.csv"))

# step 2: create a new unique variable, studyID_2 = HID-IID
serum$iid[which(serum$hhid > "7000")] = serum$iid[which(serum$hhid > "7000")]*10
serum0 = serum %>%
    mutate(studyID_2 = paste0(serum$hhid, "-", serum$iid), .) %>%
    select(-hhid, -iid)


# step 3: add serum information to the main file
df0 <- 
    merge(serum0, clean0, by = "studyID_2", all.y = TRUE) %>%
    select(Assay, studyID_2, serum_wk, everything())
```

```{r include=FALSE}
write_csv(df0, "data/2_metabolite-clean.csv")
```
